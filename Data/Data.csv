6- The recognition of the right to self-determination of all the citizens of Northern Ireland has involved an intensification of their democratic rights both in content (creating new formulas of sovereignty) and form (giving the citizens of Northern Ireland the final say). The political characteristics of the peace agreement include the idea that the negotiations have taken place not with the intention of winning the conflict, but of resolving this. All the political traditions existing on the island have been included and all the political projects have been afforded the same chance of success, without any limitation other than the backing of the democratic majority.

In accordance with the characteristics of the peace process and agreement in Ireland, we consider that it may be possible to find a way to resolve the conflict that affects the Basque Country if the following guidelines of conduct and action are adhered to:","ESP","",230,NA,342,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The announcements made by the Irish Republican Army on 31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command on 13 October 1994 are a welcome response to the profound desire of people throughout these islands for a permanent end to the violence which caused such immense suffering and waste and served only to reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred, impeding the search for agreement.

Page 2, 7. 
In this Framework Document both Governments therefore describe a shared understanding reached between them on the parameters of a possible outcome to the Talks process, consistent with the Joint Declaration and the statement of 26 March 1991. Through this they hope to give impetus and direction to the process and to show that a fair and honourable accommodation can be envisaged across all the relationships, which would enable people to work constructively for their mutual benefit, without compromising the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or interests of either tradition or of either community.

Page 2, 9. 
The primary objective of both Governments in their approach to Northern Ireland is to promote and establish agreement among the people of the island of Ireland, building on the Joint Declaration. To this end they will both deploy their political resources with the aim of securing a new and comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest possible support.

Page 2, 9. 
They take as guiding principles for their co-operation in search of this agreement: (i) the principle of self-determination, as set out in the Joint Declaration;...

Page 3, 12. 
...They will continue to work towards and encourage the achievement of agreement, so as to realise the goal set out in the statement of 26 March 1991 of ""a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands"".

Page 4, Constitutional Issues, 17. 
New arrangements should be in accordance with the commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration. They should acknowledge that it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. If in future a majority of the people there wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish. 

Page 5, Constitutional Issues, 20.
...This new approach for Northern Ireland, based on the continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of the people there, will be enshrined in British constitutional legislation embodying the principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration and this Framework Document, either by amendment of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation, and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.

Page 11, East-West Structures, 42.
...The Conference will be the principal instrument for an intensification of the co-operation and partnership between both Governments, with particular reference to the principles contained in the Joint Declaration, in this Framework Document and in the new Agreement, on a wide range of issues concerned with Northern Ireland and with the
relations between the two parts of the island of Ireland. It will facilitate the promotion of lasting peace, stability, justice and reconciliation among the people of the island of Ireland and maintenance of effective security co-operation between the two Governments.","GBR","IRL",200,205,315,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

The Agreement remains the template for political progress, has been endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South, and is the only sustainable basis for a fair and honourable accommodation between all traditions.","GBR","IRL",200,205,315,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,3,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

... Whereas in the Oslo Agreement of 30 March 1990, the delegation of the National Reconciliation Commission of Guatemala (CNR), acting with the full support of the Government of Guatemala, and the delegation of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), acting with the full support of its General Command, placed on record their express determination to find ways to solve the nation's problems peacefully by political means,
Whereas on 24 April 1991, the process of direct negotiation began between the Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), the Parties having pledged that the political agreements reached would reflect the legitimate aspirations of all Guatemalans and would be drawn up in accordance with the constitutional framework in force and with the El Escorial agreements, in which URNG and the country's political parties had pledged to promote such reforms of the Political Constitution of the Republic as were necessary for the reconciliation of all Guatemalans, the ending of the internal armed conflict, the peaceful solution of the nation's problems by political means and full respect for and application of the law,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms will contribute to political stability, the strengthening of civilian power and the agreed redefinition of the functions of the armed forces for the new era in the country's history which will begin with the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional, political, economic,¬†social and ethnic issues, on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity,

Page 2, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on¬†Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples
4. This Agreement provides for constitutional recognition of the identity of the Maya, Garifuna and Xinca peoples and, from that standpoint, of the need to define and characterize the Guatemalan State as being one of national unity and multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual in nature. It is not just a matter of recognizing the existence and identity of various ethnic groups, as article 66 of the Constitution currently does, but of recognizing that the very make-up of society, without prejudice to the unity of the nation and the State, is characterized in that way; this also entails recognizing the specific nature of indigenous people's spirituality as an essential component of their world view and of the transmission of their values, and granting official constitutional recognition to indigenous languages as one of the mainstays of national culture and as a vehicle for acquiring and transmitting indigenous people's world view, knowledge and cultural values.

Page 3, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on¬†Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Identity of the Maya, Official recognition of indigenous languages
7. Sponsor in the Congress of the Republic, in accordance with the conclusions of the Official Recognition Commission established under the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the necessary constitutional amendments arising out of the Commission's work.

Page 3, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the¬† Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the¬† Armed Forces in a Democratic Society
10. Within the framework of the modernization of State institutions, the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society provides for constitutional reforms with respect to the Congress of the Republic, the Judiciary, the functions of the President of the Republic, and the Guatemalan armed forces. The aim is not to propose case-by-case measures, but to reformulate the whole conception of State organs and institutions with a view to strengthening democracy in line with present-day constitutional trends.

Page 6, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the¬† Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the¬† Armed Forces in a Democratic Society, Functions of the President of the Republic
24. With regard to the functions of the President of the Republic, it has been agreed to sponsor the inclusion of the following in article 183:
... ""To order these exceptional measures, the President of the Republic shall issue the corresponding agreement. The action of the armed forces shall be limited to such time and modalities as are strictly necessary and shall¬†cease as soon as its purpose has been achieved. The President of the Republic shall keep the Congress informed of the operations of the armed forces, and the Congress may at any time order that such operations shall cease. In any event, within 15 days following the end of such operations,¬†the President of the Republic shall submit to the Congress a detailed report on the action of the armed forces.""

Page 7-8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME
Whereas:
... The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors, including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans, the capacity of political parties to fulfil people's expectations, the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education, all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen.
... This Agreement seeks to promote legal and institutional reforms which will remedy those shortcomings and constraints and, together with the other peace agreements, help to improve the electoral regime as an instrument of democratic transformation.

Page 8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Electoral Reform Commission
3. It is recommended that the above Commission be constituted no later than three months after the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and that it complete its work no later than six months from the date of its establishment. In order to achieve its objectives, the Commission would have to encourage an extensive pluralistic debate on the subject of Guatemala's electoral regime.

Page 11, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Public information campaigns
19. In order to ensure that these campaigns are effective, account would have to be taken of the importance of using the various languages of indigenous peoples, as agreed in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Page 14, STRAND TWO, NORTH/SOUTH MINISTERIAL COUNCIL, 10. 
The two Governments will make necessary legislative and other enabling preparations to ensure, as an absolute commitment, that these bodies, which have been agreed as a result of the work programme, function at the time of the inception of the British-Irish Agreement and the transfer of powers, with legislative authority for these bodies transferred to the Assembly as soon as possible thereafter. Other arrangements for the agreed co-operation will also commence contemporaneously with the transfer of powers to the Assembly.

Page 17, STRAND TWO, BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, 1.
There will be a new British-Irish Agreement dealing with the totality of relationships. It will establish a standing British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which will subsume both the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council and the Intergovernmental Conference established under the 1985 Agreement.

Page 17, STRAND TWO, BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, 9. 
The Conference will keep under review the workings of the new British-Irish Agreement and the machinery and institutions established under it, including a formal published review three years after the Agreement comes into effect. Representatives of the Northern Ireland Administration will be invited to express views to the Conference in this context. The Conference will contribute as appropriate to any review of the overall political agreement arising from the multi-party negotiations but will have no power to override the democratic arrangements set up by this Agreement.

The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initialled at Dayton, Ohio, United States of America, on 21 November 1995 by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (see A/50/790-S/1995/999) provides the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the opportunity to rebuild their lives together in peace and prosperity...

Page 1, 2. 
The Peace Agreement will be signed at the Paris Conference on 14 December 1995. That Conference will mark a further important stage in bringing about recognition between the States in the region and will initiate promotion of good neighbourly relations between them.

Page 1, 3. 
The purpose of the London Peace Implementation Conference is to mobilize the international community behind a new start for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Conference agrees that the peace should result in:...(h) Successful implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium;

Page 2-3, Military implementation 8.
The military mission was described as having the following primary tasks: (a) To ensure continued compliance with the Cessation-of-Hostilities Agreement;

Page 3, Military implementation, 9. 
General Joulwan said that, in addition to these key tasks, IFOR might be asked to undertake the following supporting tasks within the limits of its capabilities: (a) To help create secure conditions for the conduct by others of other tasks associated with the Peace Agreement (though IFOR would not undertake humanitarian tasks itself);

Page 3, Regional stabilization, 12. 
The Conference therefore strongly: (a) Urges the parties to observe the deadlines set out in the Peace Agreement for agreeing on such measures;

Page 4, Civilian implementation, 14. 
Mr. Bildt identified in particular the need for early action in Sarajevo to create confidence between the communities. Bosnia and Herzegovina has requested the cooperation of the High Representative in the project of a unified Sarajevo as the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as called for by the Peace Agreement...

Page 4, High Representative, 18. 
Following consultation with the Government of Bosnia the Conference approved the designation of Mr. Carl Bildt as High Representative and expressed gratitude for his willingness to take on this responsibility. It notes that Mr. Bildt will continue to act as EU Mediator for Former Yugoslavia and in that capacity will work closely with the EU Troika. The Conference invites the United Nations Security Council to agree to Mr. Bildt‚Äôs designation as High Representative.

Page 5, Administrative structures for civilian implementation, 20. 
The Conference concludes that, with the signature of the Peace Agreement, important objectives of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have been met and a new structure is required to manage peace implementation.

Page 6, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 23. 
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has involved great suffering among the civilian population. Over 2.1 million people have been displaced or become refugees. The Conference acknowledges the great contribution made during the conflict by UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, funded in large part by EU, as well as the support given in the countries of asylum. It agrees that an early objective of the Peace Agreement is to create secure conditions for the safe and orderly return of refugees and displaced persons to places of their choice.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 25.
The President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drew attention to the Committee‚Äôs tasks in respect of prisoners and missing persons. Fulfilment of the Peace Agreement will require: ...(b) Full cooperation of the parties over the release of prisoners and the provision of information about the fate of persons unaccounted for, as set out in the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 27. 
The parties undertake to comply urgently and fully with their obligations in creating the conditions necessary for the early, safe and orderly return of refugees and to cooperate fully with ICRC to ensure the early release of prisoners in accordance with the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Protection of human rights, 30. 
The Conference takes note of the commitments made by the parties in the Peace Agreement...

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 31. 
The Conference underlines the relationship between the fulfilment by the parties of their commitments in the Peace Agreement, including the observance of the highest standards of human rights and the readiness of the international community to commit financial resources for reconstruction and development.

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 32. 
The Conference decides that, in view of the human rights situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, urgent action is needed in the following areas:...(c) OSCE should appoint an ombudsman, as provided for in the Peace Agreement; (d) The relevant Council of Europe organs should appoint members of the constitutional court for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the human rights chamber, as provided for in the Peace Agreement;

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 33. 
The Conference agrees that the High Representative or his representative will chair a human rights task force in Sarajevo, bringing together the organizations and agencies involved in the implementation of the Peace Agreement.

Page 8, Elections, 34. 
The Conference notes that, between six and nine months after signature of the Peace Agreement, elections supervised by a provisional election commission established by OSCE will be held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These elections are of paramount importance in bringing about a democratic and stable country.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 46. 
An informal meeting involving a number of delegations closely concerned was held in the margins of the Conference to discuss the implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 47. 
There was recognition of the crucial importance of successful implementation of this Agreement. The international community will play its part. The United Nations Secretary-General will issue a report by 14 December. The United States of America declared its readiness to nominate a candidate to head the Transitional Administration, which will govern the region during the transitional period for which the Basic Agreement provides. It was agreed that no effort should be spared to find and deploy quickly adequate international forces required for the transitional period.

...We also have common views on the most productive immediate steps to take. These should lead to implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions as well as the elaboration of further steps.

The economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council against Serbia and Montenegro must be rigorously enforced by all members of the UN until the necessary conditions set out in Security Council Resolution 820, including the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops from territories occupied by force, are met for lifting the sanctions.

Page 2, 3. 
Sealing borders. We note the pledge of the Belgrade authorities to close the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Peace Plan. We are watching to see if the border closure is effective. Although the primary responsibility for enforcing this step belongs to Belgrade, we can assist, for instance by placing monitors on the borders or providing technical expertise or conducting aerial surveillance. We also note the willingness expressed by the Zagreb authorities for monitoring to take place along the border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Page 3, 7. 
Durable peace. Negotiated settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, building on the Vance-Owen process and intensified international cooperation and effort, is the way a durable peace can be established. France, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States will assist and actively participate in a continued political process to this end. To the extent that the parties decide to implement promptly mutually-agreed provisions of the Vance-Owen plan, this is to be encouraged.","BIH","",346,NA,389,NA,NA,215,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

This is why the Union, while searching for a global solution to the problems of the former Yugoslavia, is of the opinion that the following priorities are essential:
...
- a solution for Bosnia Herzegovina based on the ""Geneva package"";

1) The Presidency has given a first report to the Ministers, following its contacts with UNHCR and UNPROFOR, on the choice of privileged itineraries (see attachment). The choice of the itinerary will be left to the organisations in charge of the delivery of aid in consulatation with UNPROFOR and this in function of the military situation, agreements concluded in the field, the climate and the condition of the routes.

Page 2, II. Action Plan for a political solution, A.A negotiated solution for BiH
1. The Council believes that the parties must look for a negotiated settlement based on the acquis of Geneva, as was finalised on H.M.S. Invincible on 20 September. 

Page 3, II. Action Plan for a political solution, B. Situation in the Croatian territories under UNPROFOR mandate.
The European Union is perfectly aware of the validity of the claims of Croatia and of the support that it is entitled to expect from the international community for the full implementation of the Vance Plan. For lack of a rapid final solution, the European Union will concentrate on the adoption of a modus vivendi comprising a ceasefire and confidence-building measures in conformity with Resolution 847 of the Security Council.

In their Joint Communique of 28 February 1996, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach confirmed that all-party negotiations will be convened on Monday 10 June 1996 following intensive consultations with the relevant political parties and the completion of a broadly acceptable elective process. This paper sets out proposals drawn up by the British and Irish Governments aimed at securing widespread agreement between the two Governments and the relevant political parties on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of all-party negotiations.

Page 1, Agenda, 4. 
Both Governments, as signatories of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, reaffirm that they would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement, if that can be achieved through direct discussion and negotiation between all the parties concerned...

Page 2, Participation, 6. 
Negotiations will involve the participation, in the appropriate strands, of representatives of both Governments and all those political parties operating in Northern Ireland (hereafter referred to as ""the political parties"") which achieve representation through an elective process and which, as set out in the communique of 28 February 1996, establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.

Page 2, Participation, 7. 
In the communique of 28 February, both Governments expressed the hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations. However, both Governments are also agreed that the resumption of Ministerial dialogue with Sinn Fein, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.

Page 2-3, Participation, 10. 
In their Communique of 28 February, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister said; ""They recognise that confidence building measures will be necessary. As one such measure, all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the International Body. They would also need to address, at that stage, its proposals on decommissioning. Confidence building would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.""","GBR","IRL",200,205,315,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

2. On consideration of various demands of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and consequent upon Tripartite Meeting held on 25.7.1988 at New Delhi between the Union Home Minister, Government of West Bengal and Shri Subash Ghisingh, President, GNLF, a Memorandum of Settlement (Darjeeling Accord) was signed on 22.8.1988. Pursuant to another meeting between the Union Home Minister and Shri Subash Ghisingh, President GNLF at New Delhi on 25.7. 1988, a further Memorandum of Settlement was signed on 23.8.1988.

Page 1,
3. Pursuant to the above mentioned Settlement, GNLF agreed to drop the demand for a separate State of Gorkhaland and an autonomous hill council, viz, Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), was set up under ‚ÄòThe Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act, 1988‚Äô notified by the Government of West Bengal on 15.10.1988. The hill areas under DGHC comprised of the three hill Sub-Divisions of Darjeeling District, viz, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong and 13 mouzas of Siliguri Sub-Division of that District.

Page 1,
4. However, Shri Subash Ghisingh (former Chairman and Chief Executive Councilor, DGHC, presently Administrator) had been demanding constitutional status for the DGHC as, according to him, the abovementioned Settlements could not fulfill the aspirations of the people of Darjeeling. A series of tripartite meetings were held between Government of India, Government of West Bengal and Shri Subash Ghisingh to review the implementation of Darjeeling Accord and further issues arising from it. As a result of these meetings, it is hereby agreed in principle to create a self-governing body for the Darjeeling hill areas in the State of West Bengal.","IND","",750,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
